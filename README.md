<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>

I made a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and honestly, it was a fun little project. I started it just to practice coding, but it ended up teaching me a lot.

At first, it was tricky getting the game logic right—like tracking moves and figuring out when someone wins—but once it all clicked, it felt pretty awesome. 
I also spent time making it look nice and clean with CSS, which made it even more fun to play around with.

In the end, it was a great way to practice and see how a simple idea can turn into something interactive. I’m excited to keep building on what I learned!
